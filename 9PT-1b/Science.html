Composting is a process where we use our food scraps or organic materials to create a fertilizer to improve the quality of soil. Compost acts as a fertilizer because the nutrients from food scraps are beneficial to soil, thus increasing quality. This study focuses on how it affects plants, we are interested specifically about how the use of coffee beans or eggshells as a fertilizer affect a Malabar Spinach plant (Basella Alba) compared to without using any compost at all. The reason for our selection of these materials is because of how accessible they are. Many simply throw away eggshells and coffee beans because they assume they have already fulfilled their purpose which we see as a missed opportunity. These organic materials contain nutrients that are beneficial for plants and we don’t even need to buy anything. We can just use cracked eggshells and old coffee beans instead of throwing them away to save waste and also help plants.

Our research about the SMAC SISTERS helped us find the problems they are facing. One of the big problems we have discovered is their lack of funding. They aren’t supported by the government and rely on sponsors and favors from friends. Composting can help the community because it can reduce the severity of the problem because it helps save money. Composting is very easy to do, simply you can use food scraps like vegetable shavings, egg shells, maybe even coffee beans instead of throwing them away, and dig it under the soil. It helps increase soil quality, saving you money spent on fertilizer, and even reduces money spent on food because you can create an urban garden for vegetables and fruits. Composting is also helpful for the environment because not only do you prevent food waste, enrich soils, but because of how compost can carry large amounts of water, it helps the plants and the water absorbed can reach places like lakes and replenish it with cleaner water because of its ability to filter it.

<b>Statement of the problem<b><br>

<u>What is the effect of Coffee Bean or Eggshell fertilizer on the height and number of leaves of Basella Alba?</u><br>

The issue that is in need of study is the benefits of compost, specifically egg shells or coffee beans to a Malabar Spinach plant (Basella Alba). We are trying to understand whether egg shells as compost are more beneficial than coffee beans or vice versa. It can also help us see whether compost itself changes the result of a plant compared to a plant that doesn’t use compost.

<b>Hypothesis<b><br>
<p align ="left">
<font size = "4" = color = "#34282C" = face= "Calibri">
If eggshell fertilizer were used instead of coffee bean fertilizer, then the basella alba would grow taller and have more leaves.
