We have access to factors of production such as land, capital, labor, and entrepreneurship. The group members, our labour resources and entrepreneurs, have experience in planting and
taking care of plants. This is helpful so we can sell plants of good quality. In addition to this we are currently researching composting  which is beneficial to help us with our
 gardening-based business idea. We can make use of our natural resources such as land at home to begin the business. Moreover, savings from each members is good enough to invest in
 a small start-up that will kick start the project.

  Looking back at the institution needs and resources that we possess, the best option for us is to sell grown vegetables, plants, organic fertilizer. Currently, we have access to all the factors of 
  production that will allow us to put up some business. We have the land in the institution and our own homes to grow these plants/test the fertilizer. We have enough starting 
  capital to buy the seeds for planting. There is enough people to carry out certain tasks. Lastly, we can use the study on effective fertilizers that we are developing in our 
  Chemistry class in order to grow vegetables and plants to sell. We see this  as the most beneficial option because we have all the necessary materials to put up this kind of 
  business and it is something that they can continue to carry out even after we leave. 
<br><br>

 <font size = "5" face = "Calibri"> 
The proposal itself is already sustainable as it is, however, if we were to further it, then we could give our study about growing crops to our partner institution. 
We will make sure that we leave knowing that they have the full information about how to run the proposed business. The materials needed to run this business are fairly 
cheap and low maintenance making it easy for the foundation to pursue it in the long run. Additionally the products they sell are mainly used for gardening, perfect for 
people who want to start it or those who already have. This means that there will always be a target audience for this business or someone that would want to buy these
 things. It covers people that want to just buy vegetables to eat and even people that will constantly need materials to grow their own crops.
